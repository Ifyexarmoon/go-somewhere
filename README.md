go-somewhere is a custom nord themed new tab page I made for myself. I was inspired to make it by [wlfys-minimal-startpage](https://gitlab.com/wolfiy/wlfys-minimal-startpage), and designed this based on simlilar ideas.
It is responsive to screen size and has dark and light mode support. It is available [here](https://ifyexarmoon.github.io/go-somewhere/).
Artists are linked to on the page itself, for the sake of it always being up to date if I change the images.
Example images:
