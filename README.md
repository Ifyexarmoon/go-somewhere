go somewhere is a custom new tab page I made for myself. It is responsive to screen size and has dark and light mode support. It is available [here](https://ifyexarmoon.github.io/go-somewhere/). Feel free to use it or make your own based on it, I would appreciate if I was credited though.
Here is an image of how it looks on the ipad in dark mode. (links may be outdated)
