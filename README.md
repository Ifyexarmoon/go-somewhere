go-somewhere is a custom nord theme new tab page I made for myself. I was inspired to make it by [wlfys-minimal-startpage](https://gitlab.com/wolfiy/wlfys-minimal-startpage), even if the code isn't based on it.
It is responsive to screen size and has dark and light mode support. It is available [here](https://ifyexarmoon.github.io/go-somewhere/). Feel free to use it or make your own based on it, I would appreciate if I was credited though.
